# Votes

Votes is a Rails application that leverages the voting functionality to give the users the ability
to upvote and downvote movies that are stored in a database. It's also got user authentication functionality in 
place to make sure users sign in and out. This application took me less than an hour to build and will work quickly 
after cloning this repository. Just run `bundle install`, `rake db:migrate`, and `rails server` in your terminal, 
and you'll be able to view this on `localhost:3000` in your browser.
